CineMoco
========
####To update your controller:
1. Download the ZIP file form our GitHub account at https://github.com/cinetics/CineMoco/archive/master.zip
2. Download the Arduino software from http://arduino.cc/en/main/software . Be sure to download version 1.0.6 (an older version). The newest version does not work with the CineMoco
2. Connect to computer via USB.
3. If you are using Windows, follow the instructions here https://cinetics.com/content/arduino-update-instructions.pdf
4. If your are using Mac, navigate to the "autoupdate" script in the Mac folder. You will need to right-click, and then "Open" and "Open" again when it tells you it's from an unidentified developer. On windows you should be able to just double click, but you may recieve a similar warning.  Allow the script to run.  (The Mac script should work on Linux as well)


The easier_instructions.pdf has a nice graphic to walk you through this process.

  
####If you are interested in hacking on the CineMoco:
The Arduino code can be found inside of "CineMoco-vX.X" folder.

Cheers!
